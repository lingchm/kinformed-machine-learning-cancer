<h3 id="machine-learning-for-cancer">Machine Learning for Cancer</h3>

<p>Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat in the medical field, with its incidence escalating alongside the increasing global life expectancy. Machine learning has enabled in-depth analysis of rich multi-omics profiles and medical imaging for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Still, cancer applications present several modeling challenges for machine learning models, including the limited labeled sample sizes, the intricate interplay of high-dimensionality data types, the heterogeneity observed among patients and within tumors, and concerns about model interpretability.</p>

<p>One strategy to tackle these challenges is to integrate biomedical knowledge into machine learning models, referred to as <strong>knowledge informed machine learning (KIML)</strong>. By regularizing the learning process using domain knowledge, the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of models can be improved. Over the past decase, knowledge-informed machine learning has garnered increasing interest and demonstrated success across scientific, engineering, and health applications, particularly as a solution for settings with limited training data.</p>

<h3 id="a-review-of-kiml-for-cancer">A Review of KIML for Cancer</h3>

<p>Here, we focus on knowledge informed machine learning models applied in the cancer domain, where rich biomedical knowledge exists. We reviewed 127 related papers since 2012, including both machine learning and deep learning studies.</p>

<p>All papers were categorized based on three dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What type of data is used for this application?</em></li>
  <li><em>In what form is the knowledge represented?</em></li>
  <li><em>How is the knowledge integrated into the machine learning pipeline?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>An overview of the surveyed papers by category is shown below:</p>

Training was done on over 113,000,000 CDR3beta sequeances from TCRdb database, coverting over 29 diseases and 10 tissues. The model was trained using masked language modeling tasks. The authors also propose a pMHC-BERT embedding model that share similar architecture as the TCR embedding model. Finally, the TABR-BERT model is trained to predct TCR-pMHC interaction. This approach mitigates the challenge of limited training data in TCR-pMHC binding prediction models.

      		   This study aims to improve the Bacillus Calmette-GÃ©rin (BCG)-based treatment protocols by changing the âone-size-fits-allâ approach with a more personalized one. This was done by integration of a machine learning component which is used to assess and adjust the modelâs parameters over individuals and over time. Specifically, in the BCG model, the scalar parameters were replaced with functions that depend on time and the socio-demographics of the patient, and a term associated with the presence of immune cells based on the level of the patientâs activeness was added to the immune cell populations. The authors carefully designed a parameter fitting procedure to estimate the personalized model parameters overcoming the limited labeled samples

This study proposes a semi-automatic contour detection that adopts radiologist-defined data seed points as a prior. The seed points are important because the segmentation algorithm (principal curve-based method) assumes that seed point is perfect without any abnormal points.

      		   The PI model need two parameters to run. However, accurately estimating these two parameters is quite challenging. Existing appraoch use sumary measurements taken from imaging with several mathematical assumptions, which ignores granular measurements. The authors propose a deep learnning model to provide patient-specific estimates of the PI model parameters and simultaneously give a full forecast of the intermediate GBM progression curve. First, a cellularity map is obtained from the image using rules derived from known mapping between ADC nad tumor cellularity and the tissue class. Then, cellularity map is used as inputs of the deep learning model. PI parameters are incorporated into the customized loss, which is designed following concepts of PINN.

      		   This paper used the MRI from healthy controls to help segment tumor for tumor brains. One challenge is that normal brain images are often monomodal and tumor brain images are multimodal. To tackle this, the authors used a "normal appearance network" to obtain a reconstructed "normal brain" image for the tumor brains that is comparable to the healthy controls. In detail, they trained IntroVAE using T1 image of healthy controls to obtain a lower dimensional representation of normal brain appearance, then projected the tumor brain image to this representation and obtain a reconstruction of "normal brain appearance". Then, in the segmentation network, they i) used a simple Siamese network to align the feature maps of the normal and tumor images in the normal regions, and ii) compared the feature maps of the normal and tumor images to identify low feature consistency regions as tumor regions.

(2) Also, tumors can be as small as occupying 2% of the full image which makes them hard to detect. So redesigned the VGG feature extraction network to better detect small tumors: i) added deconvolution layers to enlarge the last feature map, ii) concatenated feature maps that represented local and global textures.

Knowledge was used to setup this environment with regulatory substances, diffusible factors, cancer cells, and pathways. A deep reinforcement learning framework was setup, with discrete policies that are functional map states. At microscope scale, an agent that seek to have a desired phenotype at each simulation time step. At mesoscopi sale, cells and vessels are represented as agents with their own phenotype.

The authors argue that using the chemical structure of drugs as features it is not straightforward to connect with the cellular mechanisms of drug action. Biological representation based on drug-target interaction profile is a better strategy to infer the drug representation vector. They used protein-protein-interaction network features. Random walk with restart algorithm was applied on a protein-protein interaction network to infer drug-target profile as the drug features. From gene expressions, the gene-gene dependency profiles were extracted.

      		   This model outputs prediction as a function of the data-driven prediction and knowledge-based prediction. They generated knowledge-based predictions based on the intuition that samples whose difference with normal samples is more similar to the mutation patterns known from knowledge are more likely to be tumoral. In detail: 1) Extracted a knowledge vector representing gene mutation rate for each gene from an exterior data source. 2) Generated a reduced version of original feature vectors to match the dimensions of the knowledge vector. 3) Computed a general representation for normal samples by projecting original features into 1-d vector. 4) For each sample, computed their difference with this normal sample vector. The similarity between this difference and the knowledge vector determines the likelihood of a sample between tumor, thus, generates a knowledge-based âpredictionâ. 5) The final prediction is a function of the prediction by original data and from this knowledge-based prediction.

Also, spatial-wise and channel-wise attention maps were used to transfer the most discriminate part of features through domains, assuming that silences of the images are consistent inter-domain.

The kernel distribution of tumor descriptors are fed into a PET system modeling the major image-degrading processes in PET such as detector blurring with a 5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). Intra-tumor heterogeneity was simulated by incorporating unimodal variability in intensity values within the tumor and, for some tumors, by modeling the intensity distribution as a mixture model. Data from multiple patients were used to simulate patient heterogeneity. Tumor seed locations were manually selected such that generated tumors would appear at visually realistic locations. The simulated data is used to pre-train a U-Net. Real medical data is used to fine-tune the U-Net.

      		   Most existing models just use the whole-slide label as groudn truth for each patch in the whole-slide image. However, this causes mislabeling of many local patches. To address the mislabeling problem, a self-distillation model was first used to separate data into high fidelity and low fidelity patches. Then, one-shot active learning was used where pathologists picked up the most representative samples from high-fidelity data and tagged them as clean data for noise-robust training. The self-distillation model reduced the efforts of pathologists.

Based on how radiologists classify the challenging nodules (e.g. difference with surrounding tissies may reflect cell proliferation, malignant nodules tend ot have blur and irregular margin due to rapid growth), they proposed a triple-branch design to uses sonographic features known to be correlated with malignant nodules. The first branch is basic low-level features (takes original patches as input), second branch is context features (takes larger patches as input), and third branch is margin features (takes contour-masked margin regions as input).

      		   Unlike other papers that uses real data, this paper used synthetic data to evaluate whether using knowledge can improve performance of ML models. They used synthetic biological networks to generate data and compared models without knowledge (using data from all nodes to predict the super-nodes) vs. with knowledge (using nodes that are known to be directly connected to the super-nodes).

      		   This model extracts a visual attention map from actions performed by pathologists while navigating WSIs to inform the low-level feature algorithm where in the images to initially âlookâ. First, segmented all nuclei from the WSI and computed their low-level features. When pathologists look at the images, they can only see a window of reference instead of the entire image. Each nucleus is assigned a likelihood of cancerous based on the number of times the nucleus is visited by pathologists. Then, computed the importance of each feature by performing linear regression of features with the likelihood. The classifier SVM was trained using weighted-features.

Assumes that multiple cancer subtypes with different morphological characteristics might co-exists in a WSI image. This model integrates the clustering concept into the MIL setting by assuming that exists a hidden variable that denotes the cluster of each positive instance. One classifier is trained for each cluster and each cluster's instances are weighted differently.

The ï¬nal step consisted of optimizing the query case using the constraints and priorities from the reference case. A database was assembled into an information theoretic system. An algorithm based on mutual information was implemented to identify similar patient cases. Once the best match is identiï¬ed, that Clinical ly approved plan is used to generate the new plan.

      		   This paper proposed a hierarchical Bayesian model for gene selection. It tackles the limitation that genetic is high-dimensional and previous method tend to select a large number of genes. Rather than constraining the dimension or number of important genes, the authors assign a prior distribution over gene coefficients, which allows more flexibilty. The inclusino of each feature is represented via a latent indicator. Prior knowledge about genes that are important or pairs of genes that are related can be used to specify this latent indicator.
