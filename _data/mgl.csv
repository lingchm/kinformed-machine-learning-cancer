approach",Discover significant genes on breast tumors from patients carrying or not carrying mutations in the predisposing genes patients not expected ,molecular,Scientific Knowledge - Knowledge Graph,Feature engineering - Feature selection,"This paper proposed a hierarchical Bayesian model for gene selection. It tackles the limitation that genetic is high-dimensional and previous method tend to select a large number of genes. Rather than constraining the dimension or number of important genes, the authors assign a prior distribution over gene coefficients, which allows more flexibilty. The inclusino of each feature is represented via a latent indicator. Prior knowledge about genes that are important or pairs of genes that are related can be used to specify this latent indicator."
