The GMLVQ variant provides additional model interpretation possibilities beyond the standard vector quantization by providing a classification correlation matrix that indicates strength of correlations between features that contribute to the class discrimination. To incorporate the knowlege, the authors adjusted the matrix structure in GMLVQ according to the pathway knowledge encoded in a series of knowlege matrices. This shallow biologically-informed network provides a (i) even easier interpretability compared to standard biologically-informed NN, and (ii) allows shortcut paths achieved by inserting additional vertices between connected layers.

Integration: Weakly supervised learning",This paper used Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to learn patch-level labels when only image-level labels are available. Adds an additional term of the loss that encourage nearby image patches within each bag to be in the same cluster. Assumes that multiple cancer subtypes with different morphological characteristics might co-exists in a WSI image. This model integrates the clustering concept into the MIL setting by assuming that exists a hidden variable that denotes the cluster of each positive instance. One classifier is trained for each cluster and each cluster's instances are weighted differently.

Integration: Feature selection","This paper proposed a hierarchical Bayesian model for gene selection. It tackles the limitation that genetic is high-dimensional and previous method tend to select a large number of genes. Rather than constraining the dimension or number of important genes, the authors assign a prior distribution over gene coefficients, which allows more flexibilty. The inclusino of each feature is represented via a latent indicator. Prior knowledge about genes that are important or pairs of genes that are related can be used to specify this latent indicator."
