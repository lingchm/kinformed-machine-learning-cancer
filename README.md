# Knowledge Informed Machine Learning for Cancer Applications

This repository builds up the [website](https://lingchm.github.io/kinformed-machine-learning-cancer/) of a live review of Knowledge-informed Machine Learning (KIML) for cancer applications.

This [website](https://lingchm.github.io/kinformed-machine-learning-cancer/) is meant as 
* a resource for those looking to use knowledge informed machine learning for their application (healthcare or non-health related) but unsure how each component is realized in practice, and 
* an overview of knowledge informed machine learning as an emerging field.
